# CS106A--SimpleJava
My solutions for the second assignment from the course CS106A at Stanford, which is provided free of charge as part of 
the Stanford Engineering Everywhere Program. Thanks Stanford! 

Anyone taking the course should wait until they turn in their attempt before they look at mine! (as per Stanford Honor Code)
